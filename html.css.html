			<h2>Hello viewer you may be wondering how is the ashes database created? Well I shall answer your simple question! The ashes database is created with html and css!</h2>
 				<h3>What is html you ask?</h3>
 					<h4>Html stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Html is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects. To put
 that in simpler terms it's a language that can change everything about itself except for its basic rules.</h4>
 				<h3>Who on earth was smart enough to come up with this ingenious language?</h3>
 				 	<h4>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee,<img src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1240x826/a_c/03_13.jpg" align="left" height="10%" width="10%"/> proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo
 proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
 Html is written within tags that could otherwise be used as less than and greater than signs. A few simple rules that follow html are size in text can be modified quickly with style 
 attributes and different &ldquo;h&rdquo; tags.</h4>
 				<h3>Now tags, you are probably wondering how they work!</h3>
 					<h4>Tags need to be opened and closed. This is an open tag, &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;. This is a closing tag &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;. Without these tags most websites would not
be able to function.</h4>
 				<h3>Now that we have the basic of the basics how do we style our page?</h3>
 					<h4>Pages can be styled with style attributes such as color font-size font-family and text-decoration.</h4>
	 			<h2>Now to list a few of the tags you can use!</h2>
 <ol>
 	<li>p : This tag is used to put words into your site! The p stands for paragraph! </li>
	<li>h1 : This is like the &ldquo;p&rdquo; tag however this tag makes the text-size very large!</li>
	<li>img : This tag is quite long and is used to put images into your site! The full tag is &lt;img src=&rdquo;(insert url or image)&rdquo; /&gt;</li>
	<li>a href : This tag is used to insert links into your site to lead your viewers elsewhere! This tag is also quite long the full tag is &lt;a href=&rdquo;url&rdquo;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</li>
 </ol>
